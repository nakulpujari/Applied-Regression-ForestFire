### Predictor variables used include:
* FFMC Index
* DMC Index
* DC Index
* ISI Index
* Temperature in Celsius
* Relative Humidity as %
* Wind Speed (Km/h)
* Rain in mm/m^2
* Area covered 

Inclusion of interactive variables made to improve fit and model efficiency

**Response Variable taken as natural log of (area+1)**

ANOVA, Normality check, Model Selection, Diagnostics and Remedy performed to best fit model for given data with target of high R Squared and low Mean Sqaure Error.
Outlier Detection and Removal performed wherever necessary and new models checked for accuracy and for improvement in indicators at each iteration
Iterated model selected cross checked with automatic model selection for consistency and correctness

**Methods used:** ANOVA, Cook's Distance, Akaike's Information Criterion, Maximum Likelihood 

Scatterplots, Residual Plots, Density Plots, and Standardized Residual Plots presented in the report
